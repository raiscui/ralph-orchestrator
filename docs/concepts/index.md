# Concepts

Understanding Ralph's core concepts will help you use it effectively.

## Overview

Ralph is built around a few key ideas:

1. **[The Ralph Wiggum Technique](ralph-wiggum-technique.md)** — Continuous iteration until success
2. **[The Six Tenets](tenets.md)** — Guiding principles for orchestration
3. **[Hats & Events](hats-and-events.md)** — Specialized personas coordinating through typed events
4. **[Memories & Tasks](memories-and-tasks.md)** — Persistent learning and runtime work tracking
5. **[Backpressure](backpressure.md)** — Quality gates that reject incomplete work

## The Core Philosophy

> "The orchestrator is a thin coordination layer, not a platform. Ralph is smart; let Ralph do the work."

Ralph is intentionally simple. Rather than building complex features into the orchestrator, Ralph:

- **Trusts the agent** to do the actual work
- **Provides structure** through hats and events
- **Enforces quality** through backpressure gates
- **Maintains state** through files on disk

## Traditional vs Hat-Based Mode

Ralph supports two orchestration styles:

### Traditional Mode

A simple loop that runs until completion:

```yaml
cli:
  backend: "claude"

event_loop:
  completion_promise: "LOOP_COMPLETE"
  max_iterations: 100
```

The agent iterates until it outputs `LOOP_COMPLETE` or hits limits.

### Hat-Based Mode

Specialized personas coordinate through events:

```yaml
cli:
  backend: "claude"

event_loop:
  starting_event: "work.start"       # Workflow entry event after coordination
  complete_publishes: "work.done"    # Optional completion candidate event
  completion_promise: "LOOP_COMPLETE"

hats:
  planner:
    triggers: ["work.start"]
    publishes: ["plan.ready"]
    instructions: "Create a plan..."

  builder:
    triggers: ["plan.ready"]
    publishes: ["work.done"]
    instructions: "Implement the plan and signal completion..."
```

Events flow between hats, each contributing to the task.

## Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Iteration** | One cycle of the orchestration loop |
| **Completion Promise** | Signal that ends the loop (default: `LOOP_COMPLETE`) |
| **Hat** | Specialized Ralph persona with specific triggers and behaviors |
| **Event** | Typed message that triggers hats and carries state |
| **Backpressure** | Quality gate (tests, lint, typecheck) that rejects bad work |
| **Memory** | Persistent learning stored in `.agent/memories.md` |
| **Task** | Runtime work item stored in `.agent/tasks.jsonl` |
